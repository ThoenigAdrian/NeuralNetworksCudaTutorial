Implement Neural Networks in Cuda from Scratch

[Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6StFanGtmvo&list=PLdVoL2No_-X9OK8-20KOyVRki5tBMrGGG&ab_channel=ThoenigAdrian)

I am planning to cover the following topics
  1.	Implementing activation layer
  2.	Linear layer
  3.	Forward pass with multiple layers
  4.	Forward pass with multiple inputs
  5.	Backpropagation
  6.	Applying gradient descent
  7.	Training loop with multiple iterations
  8.	Cost function
  9.	Scaling

I will not create a “How to setup CUDA Development Environment” video. Since there are already many out there. I linked some guides below.
